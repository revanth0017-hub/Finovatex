Finovatex is a smart financial tracker designed for students to easily manage their money. When users add income through the dashboard, the balance, transaction list, and spending graphs update automatically. The app records every transaction in localStorage and instantly triggers a savings prompt, encouraging users to save a portion of their income through weekly contributions or fixed deposits. Recent activities, net flow, and spending insights are updated in real-time, giving users a clear picture of their financial health. Students can also create budgets for different categories, like Food or Transport, and choose between strict or soft budget modes to control their spending. Smart alerts notify users as they approach or exceed budget limits. Finovatex offers dynamic insights through charts that visualize monthly spending, category-wise expenses, income vs expenses, and savings over time. It even provides location-based budget alerts on a map, guiding students when they are near high-spending areas. Built with React.js and localStorage, Finovatex ensures fast performance, offline access, and secure data handling without a backend server. Every section, from transactions to savings and budgets, is interconnected, ensuring a smooth, real-time financial management experience that helps students build smarter money habits early in life.
